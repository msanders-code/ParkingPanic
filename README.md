# ParkingPanic

This game is written in python using Pygame. The overall goal of the game is to reach the 'the free parking' square at the end of the road while avoiding the two aliens that are trying to block the road, it is also a 2D game. IF one of the aliens hits you, it's game over. After each successful time you get to the goal, the enemies get faster and another enemy get added, up to 3, and then they keep getting faster. The only way to move is forward or backward ('W' or 'S'). You need to have pygame installed and a python 3.8 interpreter in order to play the game. Then you just run the file.

If you download the code to play the game, make sure that you update the path to the image files; otherwise you will get an error when you try and run the game.
